# LoginSys

Simple login/register system written in C++. Read/write a file, either login or register a new account.

*Complete* login.cpp -> simplest version, low text and files stored as "username".txt containing password
*90% complete* main.cpp -> version with little more dialogue, single login file containing "username" "password" as a single line entry
